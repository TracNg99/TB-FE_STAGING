### AI-Powered Chatbot

The chatbot provides users with personalized travel recommendations by leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM). User prompts are sent to a dedicated Next.js API route, which securely communicates with the LLM. Responses are streamed back to the client to create a real-time, interactive experience.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant ChatUI as React Component
    participant API as Next.js API Route
    participant LLM as AI Service

    User->>ChatUI: Enters a prompt (e.g., "Best beaches in Bali")
    ChatUI->>API: POST /api/chat with prompt
    API->>LLM: Forwards prompt to LLM API
    LLM-->>API: Streams back response chunks
    API-->>ChatUI: Streams response to the client
    ChatUI->>User: Displays typing animation and response
```

### Secure Authentication

User authentication is handled by Supabase Auth, which provides a secure and scalable solution for managing user accounts, including sign-up, sign-in, and session management. The `@supabase/ssr` library is used to seamlessly manage user sessions across both client-side and server-side rendering contexts.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant LoginPage as Login Form
    participant SupabaseSSR as Supabase SSR Client
    participant SupabaseAuth as Supabase Auth Service

    User->>LoginPage: Fills and submits login form
    LoginPage->>SupabaseSSR: Calls `signInWithPassword()`
    SupabaseSSR->>SupabaseAuth: Sends credentials securely
    SupabaseAuth-->>SupabaseSSR: Returns JWT and session data
    SupabaseSSR->>LoginPage: Stores session in cookies
    LoginPage->>User: Redirects to dashboard
```

### üìù Itinerary & Story Management

Users can create, manage, and share their travel itineraries and stories. This functionality is powered by a combination of RTK Query for state management and Supabase for the backend. Data is fetched and cached on the client, and mutations (create, update, delete) are sent to the Supabase database.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant ItineraryPage as React Component
    participant RTKQuery as RTK Query API
    participant SupabaseDB as Supabase Database

    User->>ItineraryPage: Clicks "Add Activity"
    ItineraryPage->>RTKQuery: Dispatches `addActivity()` mutation
    RTKQuery->>SupabaseDB: Inserts new row into 'activities' table
    SupabaseDB-->>RTKQuery: Returns success response
    RTKQuery->>RTKQuery: Updates local cache with new activity
    RTKQuery-->>ItineraryPage: Re-renders component with updated data
```

#### RTK Query & Data Fetching Strategy

The application employs a hybrid data fetching strategy:

1.  **Client-Side**: **RTK Query** is used for managing client-side state, caching, and real-time updates from Supabase.
2.  **Server-Side**: For Server Components, dedicated functions in `src/lib/server-api/` are used to fetch data. These functions mirror the client-side RTK Query hooks and call external API endpoints.

This approach ensures a consistent data structure across the application while leveraging the benefits of both client-side caching and server-side rendering.

Here is a breakdown of the key data fetching slices and their corresponding server-side logic:

| RTK Query Slice (Client) | Server-Side Function (`src/lib/server-api/`) | External API Endpoint Called                                         |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `storyApi` (get all)     | `getAllPublishedStories()`                   | `https://fork-travel-buddy.vercel.app/api/v1/story/public`           |
| `storyApi` (get single)  | `getSinglePublishedStory()`                  | `https://fork-travel-buddy.vercel.app/api/v1/story/public?story-id=` |
| `storyApi` (upload)      | `uploadStoryAgent()`                         | `https://travelbuddy-agents-server.../api/v1/story`                  |

### üì∏ Image & Media Handling

For features like Story Creation, users can upload images and other media. These files are uploaded directly from the client to Supabase Storage using a secure, token-based access system. The URL of the uploaded media is then stored in the corresponding database record (e.g., in the `stories` table).

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Uploader as Image Uploader Component
    participant SupabaseStorage as Supabase Storage
    participant SupabaseDB as Supabase Database

    User->>Uploader: Selects an image to upload
    Uploader->>SupabaseStorage: Uploads file to a designated bucket
    SupabaseStorage-->>Uploader: Returns the public URL of the image
    Uploader->>SupabaseDB: Saves the URL in the 'stories' table
    SupabaseDB-->>Uploader: Confirms the record was saved
```

### üé§ Voice-to-Text

The voice-to-text feature uses the browser's built-in Web Speech API to capture audio from the user's microphone. This audio is then processed by a speech recognition service, which transcribes it into text. This feature allows for hands-free note-taking and interaction.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[User Clicks Record] --> B{Web Speech API captures audio}
    B --> C{Audio is processed by Speech Recognition Engine}
    C --> D[Transcribed text is returned]
    D --> E[Text is displayed in UI]
```

### ü§≥ QR Code Sharing

Users can easily share their profiles or travel plans via QR codes. The application generates these codes on the client-side using a lightweight library. The QR code encodes a unique URL that leads directly to the user's shared content.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[User navigates to a shareable page] --> B{Generate URL}
    B --> C[Pass URL to QR Code Library]
    C --> D[Render QR Code as SVG/Image]
    D --> E[User scans code with their device]
```

## üîó API Endpoints & Services

The application's backend is composed of multiple services, each with a distinct role. This multi-host architecture allows for a separation of concerns, where core database operations are handled by Supabase, and specialized tasks are delegated to dedicated serverless environments.

### 1. Supabase API

- **Host**: Your Supabase project URL (from `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`).
- **Purpose**: This is the primary backend for core business logic. It handles all standard CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations directly against the PostgreSQL database. The Supabase client SDK is used for secure and straightforward communication.

### 2. Vercel API

- **Host**: `https://fork-travel-buddy.vercel.app`
- **Purpose**: This API serves public-facing data. It's used for endpoints that need to be accessed without authentication, such as fetching published stories or other shared content. It acts as a public gateway to a subset of the application's data.

### 3. Agent Server API

- **Host**: `https://travelbuddy-agents-server-....run.app`
- **Purpose**: This is a specialized service for handling complex, agent-related tasks. Its responsibilities include processing media uploads, managing streaming data, and executing other AI-driven or long-running jobs that are best handled outside the main application server.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Diagram

The application follows a modern, component-based architecture using Next.js for the frontend and Supabase as the backend-as-a-service (BaaS).

```mermaid

        direction LR
        A1[React Components]
        A2[Mantine UI & Tailwind]

    end

    subgraph B [Web Server]
        direction LR

        C4[Storage]
        C5[Edge Functions]
    end

    A -- HTTP/S Request --> B
    B -- SDK Calls --> C
```

## üåä Real-time Data Flow with RTK

The application uses Redux Toolkit (RTK) Query to manage real-time data streams from services like Supabase Realtime. This allows for an efficient, scalable, and maintainable approach to handling live data updates within React components.

Here is a diagram illustrating the flow:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Component as React Component
    participant RTKQuery as RTK Query API
    participant Middleware as RTK Query Middleware
    participant Backend as Backend (Supabase)

    Component->>RTKQuery: Calls `useSubscriptionQuery()` hook
    RTKQuery->>Middleware: Initiates subscription
    Middleware->>Backend: Opens WebSocket connection
    Backend-->>Middleware: Pushes real-time data
    Middleware->>RTKQuery: Updates cache with new data
    RTKQuery-->>Component: Provides updated data via hook
    Component->>Component: Re-renders with new data
```
