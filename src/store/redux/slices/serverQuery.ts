// DEPRECATED: This file has been replaced by src/lib/server-api/
//
// The server-side API functions have been moved to:
// - src/lib/server-api/story.ts (for story-related functions)
// - src/lib/server-api/index.ts (for re-exports)
//
// Please use the new imports:
// import { getSinglePublishedStory, getAllPublishedStories } from '@/lib/server-api';
//
// This file is kept for reference but should not be used in new code.

// TODO: Remove this file once all imports have been updated
